# Constraint Layout in Jetpack Compose
### This repo is the source files of the [Constraint Layout in Jetpack Compose with Examples article](https://medium.com/huawei-developers/constraint-layout-in-jetpack-compose-with-examples-20cf39172371)
<br/>

The below complex screen fully designed with constraint layout without any nested Row, Column layout. You can see how constraints are applied and which concepts of Constraint Layout are used where and how in the below image (Red: Guideline, Green:Chain, Blue:Barrier).

# ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
I would like to add the warning I mentioned in the article here, too. <br/>
> In the repo I didn't seperate composable's and I didn't use row, column. The whole screen in one file. Keep in mind that, this is not a good practice for real life. This is a just demonstration for usage of ConstraintLayout. We should seperate our composables in order to resusablitiy, readability, testability etc.
